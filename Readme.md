## **Overview**

### **AWS Architecture**
The backend consists of three main services:
1. **Python-based REST API**: Developed using FastAPI for serving requests and performing CRUD operations.
2. **RDS Postgres Database**: Stores and retrieves expense data.
3. **S3 Bucket**: Hosts and stores images.

Additional services:
- **Traefik**: Acts as a reverse proxy for automatic SSL provisioning and log generation.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Collect and visualize resource usage with custom log exporters.

All services are containerized using **Docker** to ensure availability, scalability, and optimal performance.
